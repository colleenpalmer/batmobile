# To the Batmobile!

This is a helpful starter template that pulls in Slim and Sass running on Jekyll so you can get a set up and running quickly! Holy Awesome, Batman!

### Get up and running:

After cloning this will run your jekyll site locally:

```  
jekyll serve --watch
```

### Break it down now:

#### _layouts

These are the different layouts for your templates. A layout can be called using yml at the top of your page [look at index.slim for reference].

#### _includes

These are partials or snippets of code that you can pull into multiple areas of your app but edit in one place. Super Handy, Batman!

#### _site

This is where everything gets compiled to and what you end up pushing! Look, but no touch.

#### /css

These are your styles! Sass is being pulled in and there's a compiler sheet (application.scss) where your sass should get compiled to. 

*Important Note:* There needs to be a yml header on any .scss sheet that isn't being put currently into the compiler. See application.scss for reference.

### Things that are in there but not being taken advantage of at this point:

#### _posts

You can turn this into a blog! Read up on the Jekyll docs for more info on how this works (links below).
